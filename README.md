# React Vite Axios Tailwind Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate project for creating React applications with Vite, Axios, and Tailwind CSS. It provides a basic setup to help you quickly start building modern web applications.

## Features

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast, opinionated web build tool that serves your code via native ES modules.
- **Axios**: A popular HTTP client for making API requests.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (v6 or later)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-vite-axios-tailwind-boilerplate.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd react-vite-axios-tailwind-boilerplate
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This command will start the development server at `http://localhost:3000` and open your default browser. Any changes you make to the source code will automatically reload the application.

5. Begin building your application by modifying the files in the `src` directory. You can also add additional packages and configure your project as needed.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

- `npm run dev`: Starts the development server.
- `npm run build`: Builds the application for production.
- `npm run serve`: Serves the built application locally.
- `npm run lint`: Runs the ESLint linter to check for code errors and style issues.
- `npm run format`: Formats the code using Prettier.
